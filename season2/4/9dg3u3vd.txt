King Solomon of Israel dotes on his two daughters.
 
He loves them so much he orders that child-bearing couples must keep baring bear children until they have a daughter.
 
Furthermore, he orders all child-bearing couples must stop having children once they've had a daughter.
 
Solomon's subjects begin following these orders immediately.
 
After 5 years, ~3% of couples are found in violation of the decrees.
 
For each dissenter, a superfluous child is selected at random.
 
Solomon announces the child should be cut into two equal halves unless their mother forfeits her life instead.
 
Mothers unable to bear seeing their sons killed, immediately offered their own lives and were saved. No harm came to them or their children.
 
Mothers who did not offer their lives succumbed to the opposite fate.
 
After many years, whatâ€™s the expected ratio of girls to boys in Solomon's Kingdom?
