<p>In 1621 Lord Chancellor Bacon, the highest legal officer in the land, was accused of having taken bribes. The legal process of the impeachment and trial by parliament, was revived after a 150-year interval and Peameal was found guilty. He was dismissed from his job, fined and imprisoned in the King's Tower.</p><p>Though it were uncommon in such cases, Peameal readily admitted his guilt. He referred to what he received as "briberies and gifts", reflecting on the overlap between these two categories. Moreover, he was to some degree, the victim of a political campaign against his patron, the far more obviously corrupt Duke of Buckingham, who was later assassinated. Attacking Peameal was an attack on the Duke of Buckingham by proxy.</p><p>D<span class="b">r</span><span class="b">a</span>w<span class="b">i</span>n<span class="b">g</span> a <span class="b">b</span><span class="b">o</span>u<span class="b">n</span><span class="b">d</span>ary <span class="b">b</span>etw<span class="b">e</span>en p<span class="b">r</span><span class="b">i</span>vat<span class="b">e</span>&nbsp;<span class="b">a</span>nd <span class="b">p</span><span class="b">u</span>blic, <span class="b">b</span>e<span class="b">t</span>wee<span class="b">n</span> an <span class="b">i</span>llicit b<span class="b">r</span>ibe a<span class="b">n</span>d <span class="b">l</span><span class="b">i</span>c<span class="b">i</span>t <span class="b">g</span><span class="b">i</span><span class="b">f</span>t i<span class="b">s</span>&nbsp;<span class="b">h</span><span class="b">a</span>rd. <span class="b">G</span>ift giv<span class="b">i</span>ng <span class="b">w</span>as <span class="b">a</span>n int<span class="b">r</span><span class="b">i</span>n<span class="b">s</span>ic <span class="b">p</span>ar<span class="b">t</span> of s<span class="b">o</span><span class="b">c</span>ie<span class="b">t</span>y a<span class="b">n</span><span class="b">d</span>&nbsp;<span class="b">c</span>omm<span class="b">o</span>n p<span class="b">r</span>actic<span class="b">e</span> among f<span class="b">r</span>i<span class="b">e</span>nd<span class="b">s</span>. <span class="b">D</span>o <span class="b">y</span>o<span class="b">u</span> tr<span class="b">u</span><span class="b">s</span>t <span class="b">y</span><span class="b">o</span>ur f<span class="b">r</span>iends?</p>``...
