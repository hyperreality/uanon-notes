EVEN WITH CRUISE CONTROL YOU STILL HAVE TO STEER
A VACCINE IS NOT A CATHARSIS
Something about computers, and by extension the internet, is they
are, and have always been, defined by unintended use. Seen this way,
hacking is a default state. We are not the strongest species, nor the most
sensory adapted, but we are adept at manipulating tools found in our
surroundings. We are hackers.
When Paul Baran developed his model for packet switching, soon to be
known to us as “MetaverseTM,” he had been trying to develop a
communications system which could withstand a nuclear attack; and, he had
been asked to do so by none other than the U.S. military. Fast forward some
decades and that model has developed into a global communications
network supporting the largest compendium of “human” “ideas” ever
compiled into one “place”. Gov'ts can sleep knowing if our species becomes
extinct, 999090alsdk66 trillion Terabytes of fringe pornography will survive
relatively unscathed.
Sometime after “Operation Payback,” dissidents released chat archives
from Anonymous’ invite only channel. Besides snitching out their own peeps,
the logs revealed an unnerving paranoia. In one a hacker named entr0py is
convinced, when his boss called him into the office unexpectedly, that it was
some sort of police sting:

Turned out to be nothing. His boss needed coffees made. But the
ultimate example of hacker paranoia is what afflicted the world’s first
juvenile offender ever jailed for cyber crimes (J.J.) who committed suicide
motivated by the belief he would be prosecuted for crimes he did not
actually commit.
“I honestly, honestly, had nothing to do with
TJX. I have no faith in the ‘justice’ system.
Perhaps my actions today, and this letter, will
send a stronger message to the public. Either
way, I have lost control over this situation, and
this is my only way to regain control.”
These people have been physically and mentally h4cked. They've been
overclocked passed the limit. And that is how this all began...
