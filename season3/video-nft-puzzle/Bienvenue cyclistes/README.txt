"OH God, Sabachthani, thine dentist has brought His hacksaw"

Ask everything simply, each location keyed from the precedent. 
With 32 teeth you byte down, but evenly how odd some teeth can be determined ' ' missing.
Then other times you truncate extra teeth, just to get your wisdom molars in a row.
Don't you know the Day has come when the Truth is what we care to make of it? 
Like David and G., we learnt the lessened of believing what we want to be True.
A domestic hubris.

RULERS
* All locations (including the final location in final-location.txt) are within a 150 km radius of the map location code attached to Truth 121609
* All key chars lowercase, but the accents, spaces, and correct punctuation (e.g. place name hyphens) are required
* Examples of key syntax:
    Street - "rue sainte-catherine", 
    Bridge - "pont pierre-laporte"
    Island - "île d'orléans"
    Municipality - "la rédemption"
    and etc...
* The deeper you go, the harder it gets to solve the next location (think locally, act totally)
* However, the more locations you have decoded, the easier it is to determine where the cyclist could be headed next
