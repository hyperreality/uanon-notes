A TUNE of inspiration for the dark:

My blood in the Kingdom 
My blood  next the window
I tore my  leg off
You were whole and clean
I tore my  leg off
The air was clear and clean
My blood in the  Kingdom
We lied we  here we lay
I  just dropped a wish in your fountain
Closed the safe in the room of the Paalace
We don't need  a key, what is our secret?
Something we know only when we  C it

My blood in the Kingdom 
My blood  next the window
You tore my  leg off
I was whole and clean
You tore my  legs off
The air was clear and clean
My blood in the  Kingdom
We lied we  here we lay
I  just dropped a wish in your fountain
Closed the safe in the room of the Paalace
We don't need  a key, what is our secret?
Something we know only when we  C it
