ROOM_DESCR 2
This is the West side of the building. 
On the right side of the door frame is a mailbox. 
The stairs leading down to the street glisten with rain.

ROOM_DESCR 3
You reach street level and catch 
a soaker from puddles on the sidewalk. 
On St. Urbain the cars are flying passed you. 
You probably don't want to walk in front 
of them. 
END_ROOM_DESCR

ROOM_DESCR 4
In a moment of temporary insanity you dash 
across the street. Traffic is careening 
and swerving to avoid you. Two tow trucks collide. 
Their impact unleashes a gigantic 
tidal wave from nearby puddles. 
The wave levels you in the face. 

You're going down, and quick!

Suddenly, you realize what (or who) is pulling you down. 
It's your former employer Yehuda 
grabbing you by the coattails! 
It would seem his red truck was involved in the 
accident - and he seems to be serving you with a 
hefty law suit. 

Reality is blurry. Objects and water 
are flying passed your periphery. In your 
current state of confusion you are willing to sign 
whatever papers he is holding.

You wake up several days later in what would seem to be jail.

The lawyers come eventually, but only to tell
you are never getting out of here. Like ever.

ROOM_DESCR 6
Holy nelly-kins are you EVER lost. 
Is this your neighbourhood? 
Did you really break your key back there? 
What if you only THINK you did? 
Ya. Besides, you are a free spirit, 
you don't even need a key. 
They can't even KEEP you out.
You are too crafty for that. 

You are also tripping pretty hard on some LSD. 
You wonder if they are locking you out on purpose. 
But why? To keep you from finding out about 
their secrets. Just as you begin working out the 
specific parameters of the bump key size 
(female thread = G1/8 + 28 x hose stem (52)5/velocity) 
you smell something funny. Like burning stereo smoke. 
Dude, are you on fir..PLAYER HAS SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUSTED.

You find yourself in the hallway. 
Just ahead of you to the east is the couch
in the common room where you can sit down and
enjoy the rest of 4/20 in peace and relaxation.

SPECIAL 7 (* Tap window *)
Once upon a midnight dreary, 
while I pondered weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume 
of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, 
suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, 
rapping at my chamber door.
`'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, 
`tapping at my chamber door -
Only this, and nothing more.'

As you stand there dripping wet, 
musing over Edgar Allan Poe-try (Yes, I said it)
you hear a siren in the distance. 
The sound keeps getting louder and louder. 

Finally an ambulance arrives at your doorstep. 
Paramedics come running out and 
kick open your door. 
Lying there on the floor is your roomate Greg. 
He is intermittenly spastically 
convulsing, and gasping for air 
his hands at his throat. He has eaten too many 
space cakes and called 911 again!

HI Drew, 

Sorry to do this to you right now, 

but I have decided to move back to Sweden.

I am dropping this off at 7 am 

on my way to P.E. Trudeau airport,

by the time you read this, I will probably be long gone. 

I never could stand the fact you never 

wake up before 3 pm. 


Mvh,

Cecilia


P.S. Last night I married your best friend 

Andrew, while you were sleeping. 

He asked me to tell you he wants his 

Northern Lights weed back. Not because he needs

it, just because we want you to suffer further pain.

INTRO
The date is 2033-04-20 and in celebration of 
Adolf Hitler's Birthday (he Would have been 144) 
you have returned home to 5863 Rue Saint-Urbain 
after an evening of washing dishes for some crappy 
restaurant. 

The night is dark and rainy. 
As you fumble with your keys at the front door 
you can hear Greg's jazz music pounding from within. 
Through the window a faint light can be seen burning low 
from the kitchen within. 

For whatever reason your key is not working.
You jiggle it left, you jiggle it right, 
you jiggle in the middle with all of 
your might! 

Suddenly the key breaks in two pieces,
one of which is stuck inside of the lock. 
You are locked out.
