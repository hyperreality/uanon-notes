In the midway of this your mortal life,
You are found, in a gloomy wood, astray
As it were no easy task, how savage wild
That forest, how robust and rough its growth,
Which to remember only, to your dismay,
Renews, in bitterness not far from death.      

When cresting the head of a foothill there
Lay a clearing, and atop this clearing there
Lay a letter, which read:

THE ALCHEMISTIC LETTER
TO THE BROTHER ADEPT WHO DARES TRY TO DISCOVER
ZOROASTER'S CAVE, OR THE PHILOSPHER'S INTELLECTU-
AL ECHOES, BY MEANS OF WHICH THEY COMMUNICATE TO
ONE ANOTHER FROM THEIR CAVES

Atop afoot you see the fabled cave which lies
Beyond you to the SOUTH, its illumanited light
Now growing dim. A sign above, which reads:

ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE

1
You walk inside and discover it's not a cave at all!
A great eyelash closes around you as you enter into
the third I through its pupil. As you descend into the
antechamber of yourself, you imagine walking into your
brain as if it were a miniature dollhouse.

As your eyes adjust to the light of this Temple,
They fall upon the figure of some faceless person,
Standing like a statue cut from glass, their voice,
seemed faint through long disuse of speech.

The figure says:
NOW NOT MAN, MAN ONCE WAS I
A BARD WAS I. SEE THE BEAST
FROM WHOM I FLED. O SAVE ME
THOU ILLUSTRIOUS SAGE!

(You think it rather a strange thing to have said to
yourself.)

2
Taking with you the bard as feeble conscience
You walk to next antechamber, once there
installed, the bard grabs you, and pins you
to the doorframe through all of the earth-
quakes.

With a violent effort you draw your form as
straight as possible, and stand upright before
him. With the energy of a drowning man, the
bard struggles to control his voice, saying:

I AM THE MAN YOU SEEK; I AM THE PRISONER WHO,
A FEW DAYS AGO, STOOD IN THE PRIME OF LIFE
BEFORE YOU. I HAVE BEEN SPIRITED AWAY FROM
YOU BY MEN WHO ARE LEAGUED WITH OCCULT FORCES
WHICH EXTEND FORWARD AMONG HIDDEN MYSTERIES
INTO FORCES WHICH ILLUMINATE THE PRESENT, AND
REACH BACKWARD INTO THE PAST UNSEEN.

Held by your own grasp, you seemed trapped
By this region, your own limbic hellscape,
The two people talking inside your brain.

3
You descend another long staircase, falling
further into the depths of the I, together
With your steadfast (albeit Chatterley)
companion Virgin, the Bard, who presently
can be intermittently observed crooning love
songs, and drunk texting your past lovers.

You arrive to an ordinary room, illuminated
by candlelight.

4
You walk through a short hall,
to the adjacent antechamber of your
callow heart. Your feeble companion
is nowehere insight. Why has Virgin
left you? Why does that make you feel
tomorrsorrow?

What virus of the heart and mind,
What cruel trick of fate is this?
In the center of the room, a movie
theatre projector spins the film
of your life. Do you eat the popcorn
of its eternal reocurrsion?

These and other thoughts of the idle loner,
Of the gamer who has lust and loss.

5
You traverse another long passageway
and arrive to a room wreaking like Marcy's
Playground.

6
Walking through the short hall, you
Arrive before the ruinous sweep,
There shrieks are heard, there
lamentations, moans, and blasphemies
Against the good Power in heaven.

Towards the NORTH, however faintly,
canst be heard the gnashing of teeth.

7
Descending asconce the deepening pupil
of the third I, it occurs to you
Of course Virgil has never left you,
Not really. Now returned, he turns to
you and says:

IT IS A VOICE INSIDE YOUR HEAD

"I don't have a voice inside my head",
You respond feeling tedium.

Virgil replies:
THE VOICE THAT JUST SAID YOU HAVE NO
VOICE IN YOUR HEAD; IS THE I

It would seem Virgil is on some woke
Cicada 3301 bs. You'll have to carry
on without his help, for now.

8
You arrive to eighth room, either by
the long, or the short, passageway
(You have had this thought before-
Who can say anymore, if it came to
you by the roundabout, or the direct,
journey.

9
Following a path through your neurons,
of medium length, you arrive to the
next room.

10
You find yourself in another ordinary
room, the mood here gentle but instatiable.

Since you so scarcely remember
anymore, what you haven't recorded, or
written down. We should probably mention
that for some time you've sensed a tinge
of sulphur in the air. Faintly, flowing
water can be heard in the distance.
Must be the Fountain of Youth-yet-you,
lost somewehere windsthin the Mundus
Subterraneus.

11
Padded walls, your straitjacketed lungs.
Doors and choice here are everywehere,
Your neurons firing in every direction.
Nowehere is the bard when you really,
truly, need him.

12
You walk SOUTH to arrive at a dead end.
A dead end, is not an end, and you never
really were dead. Though you're not
really here for long, fortunately, you
stay long after you're gone.

13
Your neurons fire and complete a medium-short,
or medium-long, length journey, coming from
some direction, ferrying you to the location
of this unlucky thirteenth room. In the center
of the room a table is laid out, for the feast
of Valhalla.

14
Arriving to this room, you feel like you've
finally turned the corner of your life.
Your grandiose, delusional dreams and plans
are laid out before your on display. The room
is filled with patrons and customary ghosts,
none of whom care for your future plans, save
a few, in the far corner, snickering and
mocking.

15
The room here is dark, have you gone blind?
Intuitively, you know that beyond you, just
to the EAST, there lies the gate to yet
another self-dimension; and, to the NORTH
lies the gate to yet another.

Nowehere is the bard's help when you really,
truly, need it?

16
Descending another straight and narrow passage-
way, the air becomes heavier with sulphur after
each step. The journey, though not a long one,
is slow progress, as walking through the air re-
sembles swimming accross some great channel.
Arriving, finally, to the Sistine room, you are
come to yet another crossroads of life.

17
You walk NORTH and arrive to the next room.
The tingle of water grows louder with each
step. Unlike the previous room, the air here
is PERFECT, a small babbling brook is pooled
at the corner.

Approaching the brook you hear a faint
whispering emanating and bubbling from its
surface.

Repeated by the brook ad nauseum:
DRINK ME

Parched and unslaked as you-yet-you are,
you clasp your hands in prayer and submerge
them, like a beggar's cup, into the fresh
waters of the Fountain of Youth-yet-you, and
drink.

"This isn't water at all," you think to your-
self, "it's blood." Recoiling you spit out the
blood spilling the war all over yourcells.
Nowehere are you covered in your owned blood-
shed.

18
You walk to the SOUTH to arrive at the next
room. The gate to the next self-dimension
lies before you to the EAST.

You find yourself windsthin an antechamber
which feels poignantly familiar. The sentiment
of dÃ©jÃ  vu is overwhelming.

Like boiled blood, a code bubbles to your
mind's surface:
PXXV+MP

19
You cross the Etna GATE, as where Rhone
stagnates on the plains of Arles,
Or as at Pola, near Quarnaro's gulf,
That closes Italy and laves her bounds,
The place to which you arrived is
thick spread with sepulchres;
Their lids all hung suspended, and beneath
From them forth issued lamentable moans,
Such as the sad and tortured well might raise.

Virgil appears, and decries:
THE ARCH-HERETICS ARE HERE, ACCOMPANIED
BY EVERY SECT THEIR FOLLOWERS; AND MUCH MORE,
THAN THOU BELIEVEST, TOMBS ARE FREIGHTED: LIKE
WITH LIKE IS BURIED; AND THE MONUMENTS
ARE DIFFERENT IN DEGREES OF HEAT

This said, he turns to the EAST, then to
the NORTH, and together you pass between the
afflicted and the ramparts high.

20
You walk, in some direction of thought.
Finally you arrive at the twentieth chamber
by one of either of its two paths, each of
which, are equidistantly unfurled from the
coils of your obtuse and subdued mind.
Remembering well that a warrior king is never
thought a heretic.

21
You walk, in some direction of thought,
only to arrive at the twenty-first chamber
by one of either of two paths, each of
which are equidistantly unfurled from
your obtuse and subdued mind.

Another dÃ©jÃ  vu?

22
The room is filled with weapons.
Approaching one, shaped like a gun,
On closer inspection you find it's
just harmless words:

|LIFE | |DEATH)
/ LIE / `WOUND'


23
You walk NORTH, taking a journey of medium
length, to arrive in the next antechamber.
An inscription upon the NORTH wall in the
room reads:

MAN CAN DO VIOLENCE
TO HIMSELF AND HIS OWN BLESSINGS

24
You walk WEST, but the journey is relatively
short. There is not much to see in this room
(literally, there's no light in here) but your
nostrils flare and wince through burning smells
of sulphur, disdain and perpetrated violence.

25
Journeying EAST, along a tunnel of medium length,
you cross the threshold of yet another self-dimension, 
only to arrive at the twenty-fifth antechamber.

The achrid air burns your nostril hair, or does it 
burn your nostril *hairs? No one can say anymore which is 
the correct plural.
Your saliva tastes like sulphur, which although
unpleasant, is yet more pleasant still than the taste 
of your owned worthless bloodshed.

Virgil turns to you, and says:
THY COURTESY SO WINS ON ME, 
I HAVE NOR POWER NOR WILL
TO HIDE ME; AND WITH SONGS, SORELY 
LAMENTING FOR MY FOLLY PAST,
THOROUGH THIS FORD OF FIRE I WADE, AND SEE
THE DAY, I HOPE FOR, SMILING IN MY VIEW.
I PRAY YE BY THE WORTH THAT GUIDES YE UP
UNTO THE SUMMIT OF THE SCALE, IN TIME
REMEMBER YE MY SUFFERINGS.

Confidentially, just between you and Virgil,
your head bows to you and nods confidently.

26
After taking either the short or the long journey,
your neurons arrive to their twenty-sixth cluster of 
dendrites.

Deep as you now are windsthin the tunnels of your
mind, you find the I telling yourself the same thing 
over and over.

The I says to you:
EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL-
LIGHT

27
You walk in some direction. Which is good, because
walking through life without direction has never 
been the KEY. Every decision you have made has led 
here. Nowehere is here?

28
Restless as you are, you walk SOUTH to the pen-
ultimate antechamber of your soul.

Virgil says:
THE SKY SLIDES INTO BLUE, THE BLUFFS INTO BLOOM; 
THE RAPID MISSISSIPPI EXPANDS; RUNS SPARKLING AND 
GURGLING, ALL OVER IN EDDIES; ONE MAGNIFIED WAKE 
OF A SEVENTY-FOUR. THE SUN COMES OUT, A GOLDEN 
HUZZAR, FROM HIS TENT, FLASHING HIS HELM ON THE 
WORLD. ALL THINGS, WARMED IN THE LANDSCAPE, LEAP. 
SPEEDS THE DAEDAL BOAT AS A DREAM.

A radio signal is played in the distance, wehere
you perceive there'd be the Head of your Fountain.
Handel's Water Music, cacophonously smashed together 
with Stravinsky's Firebird. 
You feel you are close to the well-source, the 
channel of water and magma connecting Mundus 
Subterraneus to its poles.

29
Glancing at your soul knowingly, you acknow-
ledge you always wehere a ghost. You hold 
your breath and walk through walls. It works!

The final room is laden with carpets of 
water and lush magma. You realize you are winds
-thin the maiden's twomb, and notice the 
umbilical cord connecting you to Virgil, Virgil 
to the pool of lush magma, and the pool of magma 
to the great Mundus Subterraneus.

Virgil says to you:
BY THE TWIN SORROW OF JOCASTA'S TWOMB,
AS FAITH HAD NOT BEEN SHINE: WITHOUT THE WHICH
GOOD DEEDS SUFFICE NOT. AND IF SO, WHAT SUN
ROSE ON THEE, OR WHAT CANDLE PIERCED THE DARK
THAT THOU DIDST AFTER SEE TO HOIST THE SAIL,
AND FOLLOW IT NOWEHERE THE FISHERMAN HAD LED?
HERE VIGOUR FAILED THE TOWERING FANTASY:
BUT YET THE WILL ROLLED ONWARD, LIKE A WHEEL
IN EVEN MOTION, BY THE LOVE IMPELLED,
THAT MOVES THE SUN IN HEAVEN AND ALL THE STARS.

None of which makes any sense to you.

It's the last room anyway, so you know exactly 
wathat to do: 
Completely ignore all the flavour 
text and begin looking for the easiest method, 
or at least some way to brute force the ending 
without having to do much thinking.

Meanwhile, your thoughts are interrupted by
distressing a sound, which can only properly
be described as: "Nails on a chalkboard". You 
look to the far end of the room and see Virgil
scraping a rusty nail across a giant chalk-
board inside your mind's I.

The message Virgil writes is:
"SÉSAMEOUVRETOI"
