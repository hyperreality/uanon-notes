WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO GO
I THINK I'LL GO TO SLEEP
WEHEN IT HAPPENS AGAIN
I'LL SEE IT IN MY DREAMS

THESE SAME THINGS
WHO DO THEY WANT ME TO BE?
WHEN IT ALL HAPPENS AGAIN
I MADE IT MY BELIEF
E
AND NOW YOU TAKE IT ALL BACK
WHAT DO YOU WANT MY TO THINK?
AM I JUST A PLACCARD AT THE BANQUET
CLOSE YOUR EYES I'M FADING TO BLACK
W
IF I CALL OUT MY NAME
IT'S JUST TO KNOW IT IS THERE
WHY WE DO THESE THINGS
IS SO WE DON'T DISAPPEAR
k
LUCKY, LUCKY, LUCKY I'M
LUCKY, LUCKY, LUCKY I'M
LUCKY I'VE NOT FLOATED
AWAY WITH THE STARS
s
I, I, I COULD
BE, BE, BE-LIEF IS JUST
THE CRUELEST OF SINS
THE CRYSTAL DANCES WITHIN

I LAY DOWN
MY PRIDE
EVERY NIGHT THE DREAM IS
WIDE-EYED

I KEEP CRYING ALOUD, BUT ALL YOU HEAR IS ME SINGâ€”
"NOTHING, NOTHING, NOW"
"NOTHING, NOTHING, NEW"
NOTHING VENTURED, NOTHING GAINED
NOTHING VENTURED, NOTHING GAINED
INSIDE I AM FLYING BUT ALL YOU SEE IS MY DOUBT
