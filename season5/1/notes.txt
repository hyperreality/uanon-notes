I lit a fire under the lab community that rang out like a Bell. In my spare time I like creating graphs, especially similar ones having vague results. Physics is like philosophy, there's just so much possible and can be proved! I'm tired of all these sanctions though. Can't I live out the rest of my research under a pseudoname? Hold on, I'll retract that.

What can I say, I do love talking about myself. I also love Japanese swords! Hacking? bloody hell! That's a matter to be taken up with authorities in court. I also have a law degree (of course), so I should know everything about that. Besides, I've been in deals with them for years, nothing is certain except death and taxes!

They said my anabelian proofs are like a hypothesis written in an undeciphered language. Like the RCS, most cannot comprehend, and so what if I'm bad at explaining. One thing to remember is I'm *nt*r**n*versa*, I cannot be proven wrong.

It was all for the orphans, you just have me so wrong! They NEEDED those teddy bears. I know they don't normally accept carrion unless they're from the hospital, I just can't be bothered to roll out without my Entourage. That's why I'm still The King.

So you want to know who I am, and who I've killed? How about no way dawg, our crew stays in the shadow. So what if *adb wants you! I hacked into NASA before I could drive, and I'll die of a Heart*and attack before I'd ever help the Secret Service again.

I was just looking at the c*ops! I don't mean to be corny, but that's not a crime. Grab your popcorn, look inside the box - it's the seed where this fiasco starts. Don't throw out that napkin, I haven't labeled it yet.
